Getting Started with SPECULA

Welcome to the course! To ensure everyone has the same environment and access to the necessary data, please follow these steps to set up your workspace.

1. Prepare Your Data
   
How to Get Your Own Copy of the Data
To run the experiments, you need write access to the data folder. Since the master folder is read-only, you must create your own copy in your Google Drive.

Follow these steps precisely:

1.1. Download the Data
Open the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1THmfKtnpJ7ZU5X3aETwcND2y4bs2PoZV?usp=drive_link.

At the top of the page, click the folder name, HandsOnSPECULA, and select Download.

Note: Google will "zip" the files first. This might take a minute or two depending on the size. Once it’s done, a .zip file will download to your computer.

1.2. Prepare the Files Locally
Locate the downloaded .zip file on your computer.

Unzip/Extract the folder. You should now have a regular folder named HandsOnSPECULA.

1.3. Upload to Your Own Drive
Go to your Google Drive.

Make sure you are in "My Drive".

Drag and drop the unzipped HandsOnSPECULA folder from your computer directly into the Google Drive browser window.

Wait for the upload to complete.

1.4. Verify the Setup
Once uploaded, ensure the folder is named exactly specula_data and is located in the top level of your My Drive (not hidden inside another folder).

This ensures the code in the notebooks can find the files at /content/drive/MyDrive/HandsOnSPECULA.

2. Open the Notebooks in Colab
