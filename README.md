Getting Started with SPECULA

Welcome to the course! To ensure everyone has the same environment and access to the necessary data, please follow these steps to set up your workspace.

1. Prepare Your Data
   
The notebooks require specific datasets to run. Since these files are large, we host them on a shared Google Drive folder.

Access the Data: Click https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1THmfKtnpJ7ZU5X3aETwcND2y4bs2PoZV?usp=drive_link to open the shared folder.

Copy to Your Drive: You cannot run the code directly from the shared folder. Right-click the folder and select "Organize" > copy the folder to your own "My Drive" space.

Rename for Consistency: Ensure the folder is named HandsOnSPECULA in your Drive so the notebook paths work automatically.

2. Open the Notebooks in Colab
   
You can launch any notebook in this repository directly into Google Colab without downloading anything.
